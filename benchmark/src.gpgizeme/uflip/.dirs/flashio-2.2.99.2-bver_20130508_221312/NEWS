2.2.99.2
========

- Another test release.
- Lots of simplifications related to c99 support.
- Fix generated scripts on Linux.
- It should work for SIGMOD. ;)

2.2.99.1
========

- Set lots of private functions as static, no need to clutter the interface
  even more.
- Add more hints to README file.
- Do not build libuflipwin32.a on Linux (and vice versa).

2.2.99.0
========

- Experimental port to Linux.

2.2.99
======

- Add a sequentialFormat option.
- RndFormat and SeqFormat functions now output a csv file in TRACES/ (useful
  to check that the whole drive has correctly been wiped).
- Harmonize indent style (K&R 1TBS).
- Fix build when WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN is defined (exclude APIs such as
  Cryptography, DDE, RPC, Shell, and Windows Sockets).
- Remove some code duplication in input.cpp (for common options).
- Fix a possible stack overflow in output.cpp.
- Convert headers' comments into Doxygen-style ones.
- Fix build with MSVC++.
- New Option FormatType for GenPrepare, to disable the format.
- Fix segfault when argc isn't even.

2.2
===

- Fix build with mingw 4.3.3.
- Use sector-aligned offsets for SetFilePointer() in RndFormat.
- Avoid an integer overflow in the offset calculation in RndFormat.
- Switch to SetFilePointerEx() instead of SetFilePointer() when seeking on
  devices.
- Fix some warnings when building.
- Correctly check buffering type in MicroBench.
- Returns BOOL instead of boolean when Windows returns BOOL in its API.
- Fix some possibly broken comparisons involving floats (use modulo instead).
- Fix several resources and memory leaks.
- Do not use sprintf with overlapping buffers (behavior undefined in the
  standard).
- Do not use FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN when opening devices, as the bench makes
  also random IOs.
- Fix a stack buffer overflow in GenBench when parsing the experiment plan.
- Correctly alloc/free sector-aligned data buffers.

Pre-2.2
=======

- Unknown.
