This is an **experimental** port of uFLIP to Linux. It's not a thoroughly
tested as the Windows version. If you need a tested benchmark, use the Windows
tarball on uflip.org! Feedback welcome, of course. ;)

In fact, this is an experimental multi-arch port of uFLIP. At the moment it
supports Windows (XP) and GNU/Linux (with a 2.6 kernel). On other
(POSIX-compatible) platforms, it will default to a "dummy" variant that uses a
1G device geometry for the benchmark. Patches are welcome to support more
platforms, or to fix bugs.

You can build uFLIP like any other project using the autotools:
./configure && make

To cross-compile for Windows on Linux, pass --host="i586-mingw32msvc" to the
configure script for example.

On Linux, you do not need to find the device number; instead, please use the
device string (e.g. /dev/sda). When you bench some USB keys or low-end SSDs,
an error 22 (invalid parameter) might be displayed. This seems to be normal,
as the benchmark tries to disable the device write cache, and these devices
do not have one...

At the moment, the "make install" rule is useless.

You can obtain a "ready-to-use" tarball by running "make bench-tarball" (you'll
need zip), and a developer documentation by running "make doc" (you'll need
doxygen).

If you encounter any issue with the Linux port, please mail me
(lionel.le_folgoc@inria.fr). For other issues or requests, please contact the
two authors (see AUTHORS file).
