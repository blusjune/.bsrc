 uFLIP was initially developed based on SQLIO2 by Leonard Chung although
 almost all SQLIO2 code have disappeared. (leonard@ssl.berkeley.edu - see
 http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/siliconvalley/projects/sequentialio/ )
 uFLIP also includes some lines from the pseudo random generator from Agner
 Fog (see http://www.agner.org/random/)
